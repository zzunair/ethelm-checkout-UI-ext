/**
 * Represents the properties for the text field components.

 * @property {boolean} [disabled] - Whether the field is disabled.
 * @property {string} [error] - Indicate an error to the user. The field will be given a specific stylistic treatment to communicate problems that have to be resolved immediately.
 * @property {string} [label] - Content to use as the field label.
 * @property {function(): void} [onBlur] - Callback when focus is blurred.
 * @property {function(value: string): void} [onChange] - Callback when the user has finished editing a field.
 * @property {function(): void} [onFocus] - Callback when input is focused.
 * @property {function(value: string): void} [onInput] - Callback when the user makes any changes in the field. As noted in the documentation for `onChange`, you **must not** use this to update `value` â€” use the `onChange` callback for that purpose. Use the `onInput` prop when you need to do something as soon as the user makes a change, like clearing validation errors that apply to the field as soon as the user begins making the necessary adjustments.
 * @property {string} [placeholder] - A short hint that describes the expected value of the field.
 * @property {boolean} [required] - Whether the field needs a value.
 * @property {string} [value] - The current value for the field. If omitted, the field will be empty. You should update this value in response to the `onChange` callback.
 * @property {string} [helpText] - Label under the text field which provides guidance or instructions that assist users.
 * @property {InputAction} [action] - A button under the text field to provide extra functionality.
 * @property {number?} [maxLength] - Specifies the maximum number of characters allowed.
